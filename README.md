# beginning_fpv

Getting into fpv drones you have 3 options
1. Get a transmitter and a drone simulator. This is a great way to start learning how to fly and not breaking the bank. ~$120
2. Get a prebuilt kit. $150-200 for a small micro drone.
3. Build a drone. This gives you the most flexabilty and controller over what you want, but is also the biggest learning curve with the highest price of entry.
